# Culinary Cache - Food Saver App



Our product is a food saver app designed to reduce food waste and provide affordable options to users seeking food. The app allows registered food providers, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and other food businesses, to register and list their soon-to-expire food items at a very low cost. These items are offered for sale to users of the app who are looking for cost-effective food options. 

Users searching for food do not need to register; they can simply browse the app's listings to find available food items from local suppliers. This platform aims to connect surplus food with those who can benefit from it, contributing to sustainability and resourcefulness in the food industry while also providing affordable meals for consumers.
